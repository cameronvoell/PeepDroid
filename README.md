# How to use

 Sorry to say this is a bit crude currently and needs to be made easier after the hackathon.

 - Setup a PeepETH account - you will need to do this on a desktop with MetaMask now. The invite/signup process is not yet supported by PeepDroid. To get an account [click here](https://peepeth.com/?PeepethLoves=ligi) - you can also ask ligi or biafra23 for an invite that speeds up the process. (we have 5 invites per day each)
 - Install [WallETH](https://walleth.org) (currently the only supported wallet is WallETH - but it is not tightly coupled - so other wallets could also support this in the future) - unfortunately there was no more time also to release the version with the changes that where needed to the play store or f-droid. So you need to build the latest master.
 - Import the key belonging to your peepeth account into WallETH
